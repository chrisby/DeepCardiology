# DeepCardiology

This reposiroty aims to collect open source implementations of ML methods in cardiology to make them available for benchmarking. Its structure mirrors the two fundamental classification tasks relevant for the field: Beat classification and Phenotype classification. 

Available implementations:
* [[keras](https://github.com/chrisby/DeepCardiology/blob/master/phenotype_classification/ventricular_dysfunction/attia_CNN_keras.py)] Paper: [Screening for cardiac contractile dysfunction using an artificial intelligenceâ€“enabled electrocardiogram](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0240-2) (Attia et al.)

If you would like to contirbute an implementation, feel free to open a pull request.
